Same error number as here https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1417113 , but not related.
Use same method to load media files in audio/video element. I build a minimal extension from it.

Full error
-------------
See full error with: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/playlistbooster/

A more detailed message of the bug on screen shot.

If the media stuck and the next media is selected (ffw btn) the console logs the 'resource not suitable'.

File handles are gone.
